# PROBLEM STATEMENT 02

THE STARTUP INDUSTRY IS CURRENTLY WORTH BILLIONS OF
DOLLARS. MANY PEOPLE BUILT THEIR COMPANIES FROM
SCRATCH WITHOUT ANY PRIOR KNOWLEDGE OR EXPERIENCE
IN THE BUSINESS INDUSTRY. BUT, DUE TO THE RISE OF SOCIAL
MEDIA PLATFORMS, IT HAS BECOME CONVENIENT FOR PEOPLE
TO CONNECT TO EACH OTHER FROM DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE
WORLD AND SHARE IDEAS. YET, THERE IS NO ONLINE FORUM
AVAILABLE FOR MENTORING AND EXCHANGING IDEAS AND
INFORMATION WITH UP-AND-COMING STARTUPS. THIS HAS
CREATED A DEMAND FOR SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS WHICH
PROVIDE SUCH SERVICES.
THEREFORE, DEVELOP A WEB/APP FOR SUCH PEOPLE WHERE
THEY CAN COMMUNICATE WITH EACH OTHER AND GET
GUIDANCE FOR THEIR DOUBTS.

1.THIS WEB/APP WILL HELP PEOPLE OF THE SAME IDEAS AND
INTERESTS TO COME TOGETHER AND COLLABORATE TO
FORM A COMMUNITY.
2.THE USER CAN JOIN SUCH COMMUNITIES AND
UNDERSTAND THE BASICS OF BUILDING A STARTUP.
3.THE WEB/APP SHOULD ALSO PROVIDE SERVICES FOR USERS
TO COMMUNICATE WITH EACH OTHER VIA TEXT MESSAGES
OR VIDEO CHAT.
4.IT SHOULD ALSO NOTIFY THE USERS ABOUT THE RECENT
UPDATES ABOUT THEIR COMMUNITIES.
5.IT CAN ALSO HAVE A VIDEO CONFERENCE SERVICE FOR
HOSTING WEBINARS.
